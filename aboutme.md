Hi Everyone! 

My name is Georgie Ramos

I have no other nicknames really. Just Georgie. But I like just Georgie. It was almost Dominique... but that's another story. Anyways, I ended up just being Georgie, thanks to my Uncle George who actually had to bribe my parents to name me after him. He was quite the business man, so obviously, they were swayed... thankfully enough. No shade to my Dominques out there reading this. I just really like my name.
