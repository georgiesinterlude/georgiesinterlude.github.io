You're probably reading this because you can't get that silly interview for that internship or entry level position. You probably spent a couple hours curating your resume to fit the needs of your desired firms and hearing nothing back from them. Well, I will tell you this right now, do not be discouraged. I'm not saying this to necessarily make you feel better. I am moreso saying it as a slap in the face, because you genuinely can not afford to be discouraged. The more discouraged you are, the further you can fall behind. 

However, on a softer note, just remember it is not your fault. The oversaturated job market is to blame. 

For starters... breathe. Yes. Seriously. Just breathe. All will work out in the end. You will find your job. You will find your path. Once you do, that will be your life. At least for most. So enjoy the journey. Enjoy the process. Romanticize it a bit. While I know and fully undertstand it is a stressful time, it is also quite an exciting time. New opportunities. New opening doors. You're young (or so I assume). The world is your oyster. Remember that. 

Now let me let you in on my experience with this job market. For introductions, I am an accounting major. I transferred from a community college to a four year university, and let me just tell you... the jump was insane. In community, all I ever focused on was school. Obtaining the grades, the units, the classes, simply in order for me to transfer. No clubs were joined. No internships were applied to. Just head down, doing what needed to get done.

Coming into University, things were getting much more serious. Although I was just now entering the univerisity, there is all this talk about now trying to leave. Trying to get the post grad job (like man... I just got here). It freaked me out to say the least. I did nothing to prepare for this. So, as a solution I went full throtle. I joined three clubs. I went to networking events. Speaker Meetings. Spoke with indusrty professionals. Scheduled coffee chats. Attended mock interviews. All while balancing my part time waitressing job and maintaining those grades (and temporarily saying goodbye to those beloved hobbies). It's a lot. I know. And it all came at me full speed. But I will go more in depth to each aspect in later blogs. But this is what the job market has just become. Things are much different than they were before. Things are changing and constantly evolving. 

Let's take a look at computer science for example. Back in the day, technology was new and upcoming. This made the path of majoring in computer science relatively stable and safe, as there was so much to build off on. Because of this mindset, everyone came flocking, oversaturating the market, increasing the competitiveness, and making companies in tech incredibly selective. It's rather funny, in a more crying-in-pain kind of way, to see the requirements of technical experience necessary for ***entry level*** positions. It is indeed the world we live in, and now, everyone is starting to understand. So those technical skills are acquired and learned by almost everyone. That's where the competitiveness comes in, and where those networking skills really play the bigger role. But I'll get there. Bear with me. 

It's a bit of a different story in the accounting realm. Ironically enough, accounting isn't all about hunching your back and staring at a an excel spreadsheet for 40 hours a week. As I went through multiple interviews and spoke with many professionals in accounting, I've learned that what truly helps, is your people skills. That is the main thing they look for. Interviews are honestly just a vibe check. Checking to see if your so called *vibe* is cool enough to work with. Which from both perspectives, is understanablde if you think about it. I mean, do you really want to work with people where you feel awkward around your fellow co-workers when simply getting a coffee in the breakroom? Or vice versa, do they really want to spend 40(+) hours in the office with someone who they can't have an occasional laugh with?
So, you are just as much interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you. At the end of the day, a job is just a job. It's the people you work with, the people you trauma bond with, that makes it or breaks it.
